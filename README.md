# IBATest
Job application test

Notes and comments:
-Although it seems like i needed a whole week to work out the test, it took me about 18-20 hours.
-I haven't managed to complete Level 10 as was required. I was not able to make the Jersey work so I used a different approach. I have had only theoretical knowledge about REST services and this was the first time I tried to develop one. I used university course materials to help me.
-There is no javadoc in source files because I was focused on complying with the assignment. Anyway, I am able to write and I do write javadoc in my source codes naturally.
